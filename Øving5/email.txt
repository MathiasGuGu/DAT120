Hi guys, I gotta a question and I really would appreciate some help,
suggestion, or advices.
Is it possible write directly to the datanode's and eliminate the bottleneck
to write into HDFS?
for example: I gotta 40 writers and I writes th data direct to namenode, i
was wondering if it would become a bottleneck so I would like to know
if it is possible to write the data direct to the datanode's.
I've read that Hadoop doesnt support multiple writes so how can we deal with
big cluster? I mean I am really going to have this bottleneck???

Thanks in advanced.

someway.

Hi Marcos,

Same thing is happening for me as well.=20

I have multiple disks mounted to my system but by default when i format =
it took the nearest/ disk in which hadoop binary is present.

Is there a way in which I can format all the drives mounted to my system =
?

So can we control in some way the drives or the places which we want to =
format for hdfs?

Thanks,
Rahul

Thanks Guys, I misunderstood the picture in the hadoop site. Now I know that
the namenode says in which datanode should be written and which part of
file. So I dont need to worry about it. Thanks.

Rahul,

There is a ton of documentation available for Hadoop (including books).

Best place to start is the wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/

On your specific issue, you need to configure Hadoop to tell it what direct=
ories to store data.

The configuration parameter name is 'dfs.data.dir' and you need to put in a=
 comma-delimited list of directories to use to store data.

HDFS takes the memory available from the closest partition to your
hadoop.tmp.dir(core-site.xml).
I hope it helps you.

Subject: [ANN] HBase-0.89.20100924, our third 'developer release', is now
 available for download
From: Jean-Daniel Cryans <jdcryans@apache.org>
To: general@hadoop.apache.org, user@hbase.apache.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

The HBase Team would like to announce the availability of the third
in our 'developer release' series, hbase-0.89.20100924.  Binary
and source tar balls are available here:

 http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hbase/

You can browse the documentation here:

 http://hbase.apache.org/docs/r0.89.20100924/

This release contains a rollback of some features that were added to
the master in 0726 that made it more unstable, but also contains about
40 fixes for bugs (including more reliable region server failovers)
and performance improvements.

Our 'developer releases' are for those who can tolerate risk and who
are willing to give feedback in advance of our next major release.
We're not making any guarantees that this is bug free. Its definitely
not for production deploys.  See
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HBaseVersions for more on the new
hbase versoning and our developer releases series. Also, please have a
look at the KNOWN_ISSUES.txt file next to the tar balls for critical
issues you need to be aware of.

Thanks to all who contributed to this release.

Yours,

The HBase Team

Hi ,

I am using hadoop-0.20.2 in 2 Nodes cluster. But Tasktracker in dedicated
datanode failed to start.
Error i can see is :-

" INFO org.apache.hadoop.metrics.jvm.JvmMetrics: Cannot initialize JVM
Metrics with processName=TaskTracker, sessionId= - already initialized "

Detailed error log is attached.
Where is the problem?

Thanks and Regards

I am planning to setup Hadoop in our environment. We only want the
hdfs portion and not really interested in mapreduce.

I've been using,
http://www.michael-noll.com/wiki/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_(Multi-Node_Cluster)
to setup my cluster and so far its going well. I was wondering if
there is any newer documentation or howto I should follow.

TIA

Hey,

To get started with the version of HDFS that's found in CDH3, see
https://docs.cloudera.com/display/DOC/Hadoop+Installation+Documentation+for+CDH3
.

Regards,
Jeff

Hello everybody,

i'm evaluating hadoop for a new platform.
the application is a web based application, and the challange is to handle
requests up to 1.000.000 times per second. this can actually be solved by
load ballanced webservers.
The problem now is to persist user data at real time. Let's say every
request appends some data to the user record, i.e. 100 bytes are appended.
The record would have an identifier placed in the cookie.

The problem now is to look up the user record for every request at runtime.
Is it possible to get the user record with the information about all former
requests in a short time i.e. 50 ms ???

i hove no experience with hadoop yet

every help would be very appreciated
thanks in advance

best regards
andre

This sounds like you should be looking to HBase.  HBase is a data
store that builds on top of Hadoop to meet those kind of real time
storage and retrieval requirements.

Not to sound argumentative but because perhaps I have misunderstood, Hbase =
doesn't seem well suited to realtime requests at all. Perhaps you could ela=
borate on the architecture you would use to support this application?

data starts here, goes here, this is done, it is accessed by a webserver he=
re, etc

Thank you!

Quite the opposite. HBase is all about realtime requests. It's
optimized for it. Here's the description from the homepage:
"HBase is the Hadoop database. Use it when you need random, realtime
read/write access to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting
of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop
clusters of commodity hardware.

I have specified my InputFormat to be the cassandra ColumnFamilyInputFormat=
, and also
added the cassandra JAR to my classpath via a call to DistributedCache.addF=
ileToClassPath().
The JAR exists on the HDFS.
When I run my jar I get  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/cassand=
ra/hadoop/ColumnFamilyInputFormat at the line that
makes the job.setInputFormatClass() call.

I execute the job with "hadoop jar <myjar>".

Will I need to put my cassandra JAR on each machine and add it to the JVM s=
tartup options???

Here is a code snippet:

public class MyStats extends Configured implements Tool {
...
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Let ToolRunner handle generic command-line options
        Configuration configuration =3D new Configuration();
        Path path =3D new Path("/user/hadoop/profilestats/cassandra-0.7.0-b=
eta2.jar");
        log.info("main: adding jars...");
        DistributedCache.addFileToClassPath(path, configuration);





        ToolRunner.run(configuration, new MyStats(), args);
        System.exit(0);
    }

   public int run(String[] args) throws Exception {
      Job job =3D new Job(getConf(), "myjob");
      job.setInputFormatClass(org.apache.cassandra.hadoop.ColumnFamilyInput=
Format.class);
      ..
      job.waitForCompletion(true);
   }

How about adding it to HADOOP_CLASSPATH if not already.

Add it to HADOOP_CLASSPATH on all machines running the task?
I can try that, but I'd like users to be able to execute jobs using jars fr=
om their own hdfs directory.

Do that only on the machine which is launching the job.

Also you dont necessarily need to use DistributedCache API from your
application. You can supply  libjars flag from command line to supply
additional jars to mappers and reducers.

Take a look :
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.0/mapred_tutorial.html#Usage  (look
for libjars option)

I moved back from hadoop 21.0 to 20.2 and things look better.

But I'm a little confused on how things are working:

My InputFormat class attempts to connect to cassandra on localhost.
I have JobTracker/NameNode running on one server, and TaskTracker/DataNode =
running on 8 other machines (slaves).
I also have cassandra running on those hadoop slaves. =20

I execute the hadoop job on the JobTracker machine, and I get a connection =
refused exception attempting to connect to cassandra.
I expected the InputFormat to run on the 8 TaskTracker machines..  but it l=
ooks like it's just running locally.

--20cf301d41c03dc39f0492adc647
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

i checked out (from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/mapreduce/trunk) the
mapreduce project into eclipse. Following the instructions from the hadoop
screencast (http://vimeo.com/4193623) and the hadoop eclipse setup
instructions (http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EclipseEnvironment), i did an
ant build with the following targets selected -

clean
compile-mapred-test
eclipse-files

The ant build and the corresponding Build Project were successful, but
eclipse still doesnt recognize classes / libraries from the hadoop-common
project - which i also checked out and built (successfully). is there a way
to include the hadoop-common project inside the mapreduce project ?

Also, im looking to contribute to the hadoop project in the near future - do
most committers out there checkout from and use eclipse for this ? or is
there a more efficient way you've found to build your hadoop projects ?


Thanks in advance


Goutham

Hey Goutham,

Add separate common, hdfs and mr projects to your workspace. Then for
the hdfs and mapreduce projects, select Build Path -> Configure Build
Path, in the Projects tab of the Java Build Path add dependencies on
the other projects. hdfs should depend on common, and mapreduce should
depend on hdfs and common.

Thanks,
Eli

I don't yet see this branch.  Are you still intending to do this?

Sometimes there's faults in the .classpath file among the jars that are on
the build path. Correcting those manually should fix this issue as am sure
the ant build pulled down proper hadoop common and hdfs jars. They might
just have wrong version names in .classpath sometimes (like say hadoop-core
instead of common). Check it out and fix it.

The ant build and the corresponding Build Project were successful, but
eclipse still doesnt recognize classes / libraries from the hadoop-common
project - which i also checked out and built (successfully). is there a way
to include the hadoop-common project inside the mapreduce project ?

Also, im looking to contribute to the hadoop project in the near future - do
most committers out there checkout from and use eclipse for this ? or is
there a more efficient way you've found to build your hadoop projects ?


Thanks in advance

From: Mag Gam <magawake@gmail.com>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hello,
I am trying to trim down my configuration files to avoid confusion.

If I were to setup something like this: 1 name node (192.168.0.1) , 1
secondary name node (192.168.0.2), and 10 clients. The name node and
secondary namenode will not serve as a data node.

The clients will access thru a shared NFS configuration, core-site.xml
The datanode will only have, dfs.data.dir in hdfs-site.xml
The name node will have, dfs.name.dir in hdfs-site.xml
I am really not sure what I must do for my secondary name node. What
should I place there?

The idea is I want to reduce my configuration files. Any advise?

Short Story: =20

	You are fighting a losing battle.  Throw in the towel now and plan on push=
ing huge balls of configs.  Work on a strategy for clients that are out of =
sync.

Longer Story:

	a) Any production Hadoop deployment should expect to have somewhere around=
 3-4 different sets of configuration files if you configure even some of th=
e intermediate features. [Hello separate audit logs!]

	b) You should expect to have all the config files for all the different se=
rvices.  The devs are just now starting to separate what needs what so hope=
fully by 0.22 we won't have to have worry whether we have all of our bases =
covered.  Remember: if it isn't defined, it will use a default and therefor=
e still work...just not the way you intend.

	c) Don't use NFS for pushing configuration files unless it is an HA-NFS co=
nfiguration,  full/redundant connectivity to every switch, etc.  The first =
time the NFS server falls out from underneath the grid, you're going to be =
in a world of hurt.

=09

	We really need https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5670 to make t=
his whole mess go away.  Until it is nailed down which components need whic=
h config vars, it is unlikely to either a) happen or b) work in a way that =
is actually operable for any reasonable production deployment.

Is there a means of looking up the current value of a configuration 
variable, in particular one that is not explicitly set in one of the 
.conf files?

For instance if I wanted to find the value of "io.file.buffer.size" 
(just a random example) how would I go about it?

Thanks

Trunk has a configuration servlet (/conf) that exposes configuration.  I
think it's in CDH3b3 (Cloudera's Distribution) as well.

If you just want a quick visual inspection, you can use the jobconf.jsp by =
clicking on the xml at the top of a job page in the jobtracker.

Hello everybody,

i'm evaluating hadoop for a new platform.
the application is a web based application, and the challange is to handle
requests up to 1.000.000 times per second. this can actually be solved by
load ballanced webservers.
The problem now is to persist user data at real time. Let's say every
request appends some data to the user record, i.e. 100 bytes are appended.
The record would have an identifier placed in the cookie.

The problem now is to look up the user record for every request at runtime.
Is it possible to get the user record with the information about all former
requests in a short time i.e. 50 ms ???

i hove no experience with hadoop yet

every help would be very appreciated
thanks in advance

best regards
andre

Apache Hadoop Project Bylaws

This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Hadoop project
operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project,
who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.

Hadoop is a project of the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software
Foundation</a>.  The foundation holds the trademark on the name
"Hadoop" and copyright on Apache code
including the code in the Hadoop codebase. The <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation FAQ</a>
explains the operation and background of the foundation.

Hadoop is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set
of principles, known collectively as the &quot;Apache Way&quot;. If
you are new to Apache development, please refer to the <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator project</a> for more
information on how Apache projects operate.

Roles and Responsibilities

Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and
responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may
perform within the project. The roles are defined in the following
sections

    * Users

         The most important participants in the project are people who
         use our software. The majority of our developers start out as
         users and guide their development efforts from the user's
         perspective.

        Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback
         to developers in the form of bug reports and feature
         suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apache
         community by helping other users on mailing lists and user
         support forums.

    * Contributors

         All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code,
         documentation, or resources to the Hadoop Project. A  
contributor
         that makes sustained, welcome contributions to the project may
         be invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of
         such invitations depends on many factors.

     * Committers

        The project's Committers are responsible for the project's
         technical management. Committers have access to a specified
         set of subprojects' subversion repositories. Committers on
         subprojects may cast binding votes on any technical discussion
         regarding that subproject.

        Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by
         lazy consensus of the active PMC members. A Committer is
         considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not
         contributing in any form to the project for over six
         months. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of
         commit access from the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
         lazy consensus of active PMC members.

       All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor
         License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software
         Foundation. There is a <a
         href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committer
         FAQ</a> which provides more details on the requirements for
         Committers

        A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project
         may be invited to become a member of the PMC. The form of
         contribution is not limited to code. It can also include code
         review, helping out users on the mailing lists, documentation,
         testing, etc.

    * Project Management Committee

        The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Hadoop was
         created by the Apache Board in January 2008 when Hadoop moved
         out of Lucene and became a top level project at Apache. The
         PMC is responsible to the board and the ASF for the management
         and oversight of the Apache Hadoop codebase. The
         responsibilities of the PMC include

        * Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Hadoop
         project.  In particular all releases must be approved by the
         PMC

         * Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the  
codebase
             repository, mailing lists, websites.

         * Speaking on behalf of the project.

        * Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project

         * Nominating new PMC members and committers

         * Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project

        Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be
         approved by a lazy consensus of active PMC members. A PMC
         member is considered &quot;emeritus&quot; by their own
         declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project
         for over six months. An emeritus member may request
         reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
         lazy consensus of the active PMC members.

        The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair
         is an office holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice
         President, Apache Hadoop) and has primary responsibility to
         the board for the management of the projects within the scope
         of the Hadoop PMC. The chair reports to the board quarterly on
         developments within the Hadoop project.

	When the current chair of the PMC resigns, the PMC votes to
	recommend a new chair using lazy consensus, but the decision
	must be ratified by the Apache board.

Decision Making

       Within the Hadoop project, different types of decisions require
       different forms of approval. For example, the <a href="#Roles
       and Responsibilities">previous section</a> describes several
       decisions which require &quot;lazy consensus&quot;
       approval. This section defines how voting is performed, the
       types of approvals, and which types of decision require which
       type of approval.

     * Voting

         Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the
         primary project development mailing list
         (general@hadoop.apache.org).  Where necessary, PMC voting may
         take place on the private Hadoop PMC mailing list.  Votes are
         clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE].  Votes
         may contain multiple items for approval and these should be
         clearly separated. Voting is carried out by replying to the
         vote mail. Voting may take four flavours

         * +1 &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Agree,&quot; or &quot;the action  
should be
             performed.&quot; In general, this vote also indicates a  
willingness
             on the behalf of the voter in &quot;making it happen&quot;

          * +0 This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
             consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be  
able
             to help.

          * -0 This vote indicates that the voter does not, in  
general, agree with
             the proposed action but is not concerned enough to  
prevent the
             action going ahead.

           * -1 This is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is  
required,
             this vote counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All vetoes  
must
             contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate.  
Vetoes with
             no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a  
-1 vote
             to include an alternative course of action.

         All participants in the Hadoop project are encouraged to show  
their
         agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For  
technical
         decisions, only the votes of active committers are binding.  
Non binding
         votes are still useful for those with binding votes to  
understand the
         perception of an action in the wider Hadoop community. For  
PMC decisions,
         only the votes of PMC members are binding.

        Voting can also be applied to changes made to the Hadoop  
codebase. These
         typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit  
message
         sent when the commit is made.

     * Approvals

         These are the types of approvals that can be sought.  
Different actions
         require different types of approvals

         * Lazy Consensus - Lazy consensus requires 3 binding +1 votes
            and no binding vetoes.

          * Lazy Majority - A lazy majority vote requires 3 binding +1
             votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes.

         * Lazy 2/3 Majority - Lazy 2/3 majority votes requires at
            least 3 votes and twice as many +1 votes as -1 votes.

     * Vetoes

         A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast,
         it must be accompanied by a valid reason explaining the
         reasons for the veto. The validity of a veto, if challenged,
         can be confirmed by anyone who has a binding vote. This does
         not necessarily signify agreement with the veto - merely that
         the veto is valid.

        If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person  
casting
         the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn,  
any action
         that has been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.

     * Actions

         This section describes the various actions which are  
undertaken within
         the project, the corresponding approval required for that  
action and
         those who have binding votes over the action.

          * Code Change

             A change made to a codebase of the project and committed
             by a committer. This includes source code, documentation,  
website
             content, etc.

             Lazy consensus of active committers.

          * Release Plan

             Defines the timetable and actions for a release. The plan  
also
             nominates a Release Manager.

             Lazy majority of active committers

          * Product Release

             When a release of one of the project's products is ready,  
a vote is
             required to accept the release as an official release of  
the
             project.

            Lazy Majority of active PMC members

           * Adoption of New Codebase

             When the codebase for an existing, released product is to  
be
             replaced with an alternative codebase. If such a vote  
fails to
             gain approval, the existing code base will continue.

            This also covers the creation of new sub-projects
             within the project

            Lazy 2/3 majority of PMC members

           * New Committer

             When a new committer is proposed for the project

             Lazy consensus of active PMC members

           * New PMC Member

             When a committer is proposed for the PMC

            Lazy consensus of active PMC members

           * Committer Removal

            When removal of commit privileges is sought.  Note: Such
            actions will also be referred to the ASF board by the PMC
            chair

             Majority of active PMC members (excluding the committer  
in question if a
             member of the PMC).

           * PMC Member Removal

             When removal of a PMC member is sought.  Note: Such
             actions will also be referred to the ASF board by the PMC
             chair.

             Majority of active PMC members (excluding the member in  
question)

           * Modifying Bylaws

             Modifying this document.

             Majority of active PMC members

    * Voting Timeframes

         Votes are open for a period of 7 days to allow all active
         voters time to consider the vote. Votes relating to code
         changes are not subject to a strict timetable but should be
         made as timely as possible.

Being a relatively new member of Hadoop community (just slightly over year
and a half) and never been exposed to its politics I can't help but to wond=
er
if such document didn't exist before?

If it did, then what's the difference between the current version and the
previous one? What's causing that change to be introduced?

If it didn't, then how Hadoop community has been governed beforehand?
By the general ASF rules or differently? If the rules were the same for ASF
and Hadoop why we need to deviate from them now and why?

Clearly, having written bylaws is handy in case of a dispute. However it'd =
be
great to know the history (or just a story) of this particular discussion.

Appreciate any information on the topic. Thanks in advance.

Hey Cos,

There's some background in the proposal thread from last year.

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-general/200911.mbox/%3C284E=
0999-F935-47A2-B051-7241BF8A4B39@apache.org%3E

Thanks,
Eli

With the exception of these two bullets, these bylaws seem equivalent to 
those posted by several other projects.  Most projects use 
consensus-but-one for committer and PMC removal.  Was this change 
intentional or accidental?

+1, looks like the standard ASF process

That said
  -the JIRA/hudson review process isn't so common on other projects, 
where it's usually lazy post-commit-veto. That doesn't mean the Hadoop 
process is bad, only that you may want to say "the process used for 
getting code in is stricter than many existing ASF processes due to the 
value of data stored in Hadoop clusters. The exact process for 
committing code will be defined by the PMC and voted on" -then you can 
propose/vote the existing process, but have the ability to change things 
without reconstituting.

-the proposal for big changes that was discussed  may also be something 
that this would cover

-Vetoes can kill a project. It's the situation you don't want to get, 
where someone starts -1 rejecting everything. It might be good to lay 
out what the escalation process is for resolving vetoes that cannot be 
resolved -is there a way to raise with the PMC, etc.?

It was intentional. In my survey of other Apache project's bylaws, I  
was originally surprised to find some such as HTTP Components (http://hc.apache.org/bylaws.html 
) that use majority votes for removing people. However, the question  
is whether a small minority should be able to drain a project's  
attention and energy.

For anyone who hasn't already seen it, there is an outstanding  
presentation on "Open Source Projects and Poisonous People" that was  
done by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman. I'd highly  
recommend it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSFDm3UYkeE. The  
presentation's central thesis is that a project's attention and energy  
are its most valuable resource. People that cause long emotional  
debates without contributing to the project are extremely destructive  
to the project and must occasionally be asked to leave.

Of course everyone hopes to avoid these cases, but the question is  
whether the project should have the mechanism to fix itself. I feel  
that it must.

FWIW, "PMC does not generally operate by majority but by consensus." was given as a rationale when explaining to an existing PMC member why it was ok to approve so many new PMC members from a single company.

Folks, 

I'm working to get the pre-commit patch testing running again for HDFS, HADOOP, and MAPREDUCE patches.  Since I've been on a bit of a hiatus from day-to-day involvement w/ the project over the last 6 months (new job), I want to check in and make sure folks would still find this pre-commit testing useful.  Also, happy to hear any suggested improvement.  Let me know.  

Cheers,
Nige

There have been several tests failing on trunk for entirely too long, and I
believe this will help prevent further regressions while we address those
issues.

Thanks a lot for volunteering to do this work, Nigel.

Thanks for getting to it, Nigel. This is absolutely useful and allows to ke=
ep
weeds out of the trunk up to a certain degree.

There were at least two slightly different sources of information about wha=
t's
going on with test-patch process. Would you mind to post a brief about the
situation so comments can be more substantial?

Thanks,
  Cos

Old times:
The hudson patch-testing admin job used to run on the master machine hudson=
.zones.apache.org as this machine used to parse the emails from jira and cr=
eate the patch queue for testing.

Current situation:=20
hudson.zones.apache.org machine is no more a master and we have a new machi=
ne called aegis.apache.org as the master machine.=20

This machine is configured to process the email and create the patch queue.=
  <done>
Though we are able to get the email and create the patch queue on the new a=
egis.apache.org machine, still we wont be able to trigger patch admin job o=
n the hudson master as this is not allowed in the new setup. =20

Infra team doesn't want us to run any builds on the hudson master. Instead =
they want all the builds to run on the slave machine. =20

I got the password-less access for hudson user from hudson slave h1.grid.sp=
2.yahoo.net to aegis.apache.org like 2 weeks back. <done>  =20

The plan here is to read the patch queue on aegis from h1 and schedule buil=
ds.   <I'm working on getting this to work>

Longterm solution:=20
email patch process and queue creation is un-reliable. As a long term solut=
ion we need to use jira-cli command line tool to read patch directly from j=
ira.=20
And doing this would require introducing a new workflow in jira. Apart from=
 the current status called "patch-available"

Thanks,
Giri

Ya, that's what I've got mostly working on my machine.  Any open Jira's for this work?  If not, I'll open one.

> And doing this would require introducing a new workflow in jira. Apart from the current status called "patch-available"

Not sure that's necessary.  I think if we change the patch testing model a little, we can keep the current workflow.  Also, given some recent advances in Hudson, I think we can reduce all the patch jobs down to 1 admin job covering *all* projects and 1 job per project -- and we should be able to drastically improve utilization of the slaves we have.  Let's move this discussion to a ticket.  LMK if I need to open one.

Cheers,
Nige

Thanks Giri!

I'm totally agree that we need to move away from the email triggering.=20
And in order to make changes to JIRA's workflow someone needs to work with
INFRA folks or a person with admin access should suffice?=20

I'm offering my help for either way, so lemme know.

One feature request, which may be difficult to implement, and may not be
worth it:

It would be nice to somehow support running tests for patches which require
changes that span core/MR/HDFS. As it stands, I believe an HDFS patch will
be built and run against a trunk jar, but if this HDFS patch requires some
not-yet-committed work that's being done in a HADOOP JIRA, the HDFS tests
will fail.

Obviously, just getting hudson QA running again is a necessary pre-requisite
for this. :)

Thanks for the explanation Owen. The HttpComponents bylaws define
"majority" as "A majority decision passes if there is a minimum of
three binding +1 votes and at least 75% of the binding votes are +1."
So this is not the same as the 50% majority defined the the draft.
(Actually, I notice that only "lazy majority" is defined, not
"majority" in the approvals section.) I suggest we make this stronger.
By way of comparison, the recently enacted bylaws for Pig
(http://pig.apache.org/bylaws.html) have consensus, for example.

Also, Pig has a minimum length of time for each action, rather than
the same fixed number for each. Might be worth considering.

Cheers,
Tom

Actually, there's a way to do it, but is isn't simple as you said and requi=
re
certain JIRA management discipline like linking JIRAs properly, for instanc=
e.

Another veritable here is to submit patches for all involved project at onc=
e or
to be able to postpone a patch validation if patch-A isn't available when
patch-B is submitted (project B depends on A, obviously).

After that everything else is real easy: build dependencies, mvn-install
artifacts, build the dependent one with locally installed artifacts, clean =
mvn
cache after all. The tricky part though is to guarantee that these chained
builds are executed on the same machine. Otherwise, local mvn repo
synchronization will be one huge mess ;)

So, in other words, let's restore the status quo first ;) IMO

FWIW, working at the same company doesn't imbue contributors with a
shared agenda, neither does it rob them of their ability to
compromise, relieve their concern for the project's health, nor does
it diminish their respect for other contributors. If individuals from
that company display any of those traits, then the PMC should address
them. Equating association and collusion a priori is inadmissible. And
insulting.

Consensus is equivalent to making the PMC a permanent appointment.
Discussions would be more civil and more likely to offer compromise-
we would actually work toward consensus- if intransigence and
hostility had consequences. Removing people is a last resort. Moving
the barrier closer doesn't make it more likely, but it aligns
incentives so rational people will reign in their more intemperate
comments and, instead, find ways to make progress.

Many projects require supermajorities or even 3/4 majorities. It's
sufficiently damning if more than half the PMC thinks an individual is
so destructive that less damage would be done by ejecting them, in my
opinion, but again: this is not a facility we should use, or have to
use. Throwing someone out is an expensive failure for the project, and
an conspicuous failure of its governance and community. Personally, I
don't care if it's a majority or a supermajority, but consensus is a
fig leaf.

IIRC, the reasoning for a full week in the last thread was to prevent
national holidays from affecting the definition of "working days." We
might expedite votes for security/patch releases. -C

I have been playing with mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum to reduce =
the load
on my Cassandra cluster (using the Cassandra ColumnFamilyInputFormat).  I'd=
 like to find ways of throttling the map operations
in the case I may be affecting OLTP activity on the cluster.

What parameters can I use to limit the number of map tasks running concurre=
ntly across the whole cluster?  mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum=20
limits the number of concurrent maps per task tracker.  But can i do this a=
t the job level?=20

Should I look at the "fair" scheduler?

regards,Michael=

Hi Michael,

Any of the tasktracker configs affect the local tasktracker daemon and not
other servers in your cluster.  Moreover, they can't be overridden by a job
configuration.  Sounds like you're in need of a job scheduler; I personally
prefer use the Fair Scheduler but I'm sure the Capacity Scheduler would suit
your needs as well.

cheers,
-James
